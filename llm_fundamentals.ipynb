        "\n",
        "**Tokenization** is the critical step of **converting human-readable text into numerical representations that language models can process**.\n",
        "\n",
        "After defining language modeling as predicting words from context, the natural next question is: **how exactly do we represent words numerically**? This is precisely the role of tokenization, bridging the complexity of natural language to structured numeric inputs suitable for neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tokenization serves several key purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reduction of Vocabulary Size**:\n",
        "Natural languages are vast, filled with misspellings, colloquialisms, technical jargon, and new words constantly emerging. Tokenization condenses this enormous diversity into a fixed, manageable vocabulary, making computations feasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Efficient Computation**:\n",
        "Transforming words (or subwords) into numeric indices lets models efficiently perform mathematical operations required by neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Meaningful Representation**:\n",
        "Tokenization methods, especially subword approaches (like Byte-Pair Encoding or WordPiece), effectively handle semantic similarities. They break words down into meaningful parts, allowing models to generalize across related terms or word forms, even if the model hasn‚Äôt explicitly encountered them during training."

        "A common challenge in language modeling is dealing with words that weren't present in the training data. **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**, introduced by [Sennrich et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909), elegantly solves this by breaking words into smaller, meaningful subword units. The key idea is simple yet powerful: it iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of bytes or characters in the training corpus to build a flexible vocabulary. By doing so, BPE allows models to handle unseen or rare words effectively, dramatically improving their generalization.\n",

Was first introduced by [Vaswani et al. 2017](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf).\n",

This allows the network to better grasp context and relationships between words, significantly improving its ability to process language effectively..\n",
